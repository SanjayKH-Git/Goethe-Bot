## Goethe-Bot

The Goethe Simulator is a Python-based project that utilizes Playwright for web automation and testing. 
This README provides instructions for setting up the project and activating the virtual environment.

**Requirements**

* Python 3.x (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* Playwright (https://playwright.dev/)

**Installation**

**1. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)**

A virtual environment isolates project dependencies from your system-wide Python installation. Here's how to create one using `venv`:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate.bat  # Windows
```

**Installing Plawright
```bash
pip install playwright
playwright install
```

**Running Script
```bash
python goethe_bot.py
```
